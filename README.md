# Dicionary api

## Overview

This project is a backend test, basically it is a dictionary, where you can have definitions of words, add words to your favorites list, remove words from your favorites and see a history of words already visited.

## Techs

- Nestjs 
- Typescript
- MongoDB
- Docker
- Github actions
- Husky
- Prettier
- Axios
- Swagger

## Obs

I chose to use **Nest**, as it greatly facilitates concepts such as dependency injection and is 'almost ready' to scale, things such as documentation it also facilitates, so there were several factors that contributed to this choice.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge of the project was the popular database, I had never done this before, so it was a bit complicated at first, but with a lot of research I managed to solve it and everything worked out.
